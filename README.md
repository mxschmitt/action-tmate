# Debug your [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) by using [tmate](https://tmate.io)

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/actions)
[![GitHub Marketplace](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Marketplace-green)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/debugging-with-tmate)

This GitHub Action offers you a direct way to interact with the host system on which the actual scripts (Actions) will run.

## Features

- Debug your GitHub Actions by using SSH or Web shell
- Continue your Workflows afterwards

## Supported Operating Systems

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows

## Getting Started

By using this minimal example a [tmate](https://tmate.io) session will be created.

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup tmate session
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

To get the connection string, just open the `Checks` tab in your Pull Request and scroll to the bottom. There you can connect either directly per SSH or via a web based terminal.

## Without sudo

By default we run the commands using sudo. If you get `sudo: not found` you can use the parameter below to execute the commands directly.

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup tmate session
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
      with:
        sudo: false
```

## Timeout

By default the tmate session will remain open until the workflow times out. You can [specify your own timeout](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepstimeout-minutes) in minutes if you wish to reduce GitHub Actions usage.

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup tmate session
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
      timeout-minutes: 15
```

## Only on failure
By default a failed step will cause all following steps to be skipped. You can specify that the tmate session only starts if a previous step [failed](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#failure).

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup tmate session
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

## Use registered public SSH key(s)

By default anybody can connect to the tmate session. You can opt-in to install the public SSH keys [that you have registered with your GitHub profile](https://docs.github.com/en/github/.authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup tmate session
      uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
      with:
        limit-access-to-actor: true
```

If the registered public SSH key is not your default private SSH key, you will need to specify the path manually, like so: `ssh -i <path-to-key> <tmate-connection-string>`.

## Continue a workflow

If you want to continue a workflow and you are inside a tmate session, just create a empty file with the name `continue` either in the root directory or in the project directory by running `touch continue` or `sudo touch /continue`.

## Connection string / URL is not visible

The connection string will be written in the logs every 5 seconds. For more information checkout issue [#1](https://github.com/mxschmitt/action-tmate/issues/1).
